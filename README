OpenslasHMD
===========

Experimental open-source VR rhythm game.

The code is partially derived from the Boost licensed opengl-example from the
OpenHMD project (http://www.openhmd.net) and the modified opengl3-example from
ChristophHaag (https://github.com/ChristophHaag; also Boost license 1.0).

Goals:
------

* Unix-portability, using SDL2, OpenHMD, etc.
* ability to play back songs of a variety of sources (file formats, streaming
  sources)
* ability to play back maps created by Beat Saber community tools (bsaber.com,
  ModSaber, EditSaber)
* as much modularity, flexibility, and moddability as possible
* Avoid bloat in core engine, that is minimum build and runtime dependencies.
  Any future plugins etc can be as bloated as they want.

Dependencies:
-------------

* OpenHMD
* json-c
* SDL2
* SDL2_mixer
* GLEW
